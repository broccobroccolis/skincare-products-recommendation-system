# Skin O'Clock
Skin O'Clock is a collaborative filtering based skincare products recommendation system. This is my work for WIH3001 Data Science Project.
<br><br>
Skin O'Clock is a web-based application which can help the target audience get recommendations on skincare products for their desired category.
Skin O'Clock targets to serve users who are members of Sephora, a globally known cosmetics e-Commerce platform, as our application is built using customers' and products' data of Sephora.
<br><br>
It generates products recommendations for users by calculating users' similarity by considering the users' past ratings for the products they bought and rated at Sephora.

## Application
The web based application has been deployed with Streamlit and can be accessed publicly at https://share.streamlit.io/broccobroccolis/skinoclock/main/skinoclock.py
